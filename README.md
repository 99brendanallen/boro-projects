# Edinboro University Projects

Hello, by the looks of my username, my name is Brendan and I'm currently enrolled in a coding class at my university. I decided to make this page so that I can share my progression of programming with you. Some of my projects listed on here are "in the works", so they will not be fully working. 

However, I did complete the first programming course last semester and I will roll out the other 4 programs in the coming weeks, so, be on the lookout for that! Otherwise, below, are my completed projects.
